    <h2 id="it-all-starts-with-paragraph-styles">It all starts with Paragraph Styles</h2>
    <p>While speaking at <a href="https://max.adobe.com/">Adobe MAX</a> conferences, I’ve often referred to InDesign as “the most stylin’ app in the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html">Creative Cloud</a>.” Styles in InDesign range from paragraph and character styles for text to objects and graphic frames — and can also include tables and table cells, anchored objects, GREP statements, nested styles, hyperlinks — and the list goes on.</p>
    <p>Paragraph Styles, however, are key for the Table of Contents (TOC) feature. Typically, styles used for headings work best for a TOC. To create a Paragraph Style, begin by opening the Paragraph Styles panel from the Window &gt; Styles menu. Next, select the characters of your headline within your layout. With the text still selected, click the “create new style” icon in the bottom-right of the Paragraph Style panel. This will create a style based on the properties of the text you had selected.</p>
    <p>To rename your style, or make style changes, double-click the new paragraph style in the list to open the style options dialog box. Once you finish editing your style, assign the style to your headline by selecting the characters of your headline, then selecting the paragraph style from the list of styles in your Paragraph Styles panel.</p>
    <p><strong>Advanced tip</strong><br>If you hold the Option key (Mac) or the Alt key (Windows) when clicking the create new style icon, the properties dialog box will immediately open from the Paragraph Styles panel, allowing you to edit the new style right away.</p>
    <p>Throughout your InDesign document, be sure to apply the Paragraph Style to all of the headings. Not only will this allow you to make design changes faster, but it will also help us add bookmarks and interactivity within a PDF file.</p>
    <h3 id="creating-a-table-of-contents">Creating a table of contents</h3>
    <p>The Table of Contents feature gathers the contents and page numbers of specific paragraph styles in order to provide a list of the contents included in your publication. This content is created automatically and can be updated as your document is edited. While this provides very useful textual information in regard to finding content, this same information can also be used to make your document interactive when exporting to PDF.</p>
    <p>To begin to create a TOC, find a location in your document where you’d like the TOC to appear. Next, select Table of Contents from the Layout menu. We’ll be setting a few properties within this dialog box, starting with setting the title to simply “contents.” In the Styles in Table of Contents section, we’ll choose the paragraph style for our heading and click the add button.</p>
    <p>The Options section of the Table of Contents dialog box includes the <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/how-to/create-pdf.html">Create PDF</a> Bookmarks option. Checking this option will result in a PDF file that includes bookmarks that link directly to the corresponding content within the document. This feature also results in a more structured and searchable PDF file. Bonus!</p>
    <p>When finished, click OK to return to your document with a loaded text cursor. Click to add a new story into your document that includes all of the TOC information.</p>
    <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Using bookmarks and links in your large PDF files, such as ebooks and white papers can make the reader experience much, much better. By following the tips above, you will find it isn’t that difficult.
